                            <p>I am working on providing reusable, loupes-ready PPE that protects against aerosols for dentists! 100% of the profits are donated to NHS Charities Together! The visor I designed passed 7/8 tests for CE marking.</p>
                            <p>Unfortunately, due to the industry being built and processed around a few large companies dominating the market, a new entry to the market is very difficult. The process from the government CE specification document to getting the product tested and approved by an awarding body is very expensive and has clearly shown the industry is made to sustain the few, large companies. However, this does mean that the large companies are able to continuously increase the price because the consumer has no other option. </p>
                            <p>I will continue to look through other options to get my visor design to the market. However, for now I have dormant the company as to not obtain any new costs.</p>

The volunteer group comprised of just over 65 members, running more than 30 3d-printers simultaneously to produce over 6500 visors for the NHS. Moreover, we raised just over Â£18,000 to help our efforts run smoothly.</p>

                            <p>I acquired a week long work experience placement at IBM through my networking skills and connecting with those through a machine learning project I had been working on during my spare time. I worked with Dale Lane, a Software Developer at IBM and creator of MLforKids.</p>
                            <p>During my time at IBM, I spent time working on MLForKids coming up with new ideas for different, engaging worksheets to provide kids during lessons. I focused on trying to expand my skillset so using Python and different API's to really curate lots of different services to create a product. During my first day I converted a Scratch worksheet to Python, so I could get a feel for how much effort each worksheet would be.</p>
                            <p>Knowing this, I worked on a sentiment analysis program using Twitter's API and a Machine Learning Model that I trained with IBM Watson. Using this model I was able to see whether Tweets regarding a specific topic had a bias, and labelling them automatically as Positive or Negative. Once I had completed this and finished creating the easy-to-follow worksheet I submitted it and continued to work on a new project.</p>
                            <p>During my last two days, I worked on an Android App that woukd recognise the colour bands on a resistor and distinguish what ohm rating the resistor was. I managed to complete the machine learning training model and write the program for the detection, however I was not able to complete the Android App. However, I am determined to continue the project and will be finishing the app in the near-future.</p>

                            <p>I played a vital role at the Scope shop in Harrow for 8 months as I worked there to give back to the community. I found Scope Charity shop through my Duke Of Edinburgh Award, although not completing my Duke Of Edinburgh award I continued to work at Scope. Over the months I was there to work solely to achieve the award I came to the realisation that there is not enough people volunteering at the shop, or any charity shop really. I continued there because of my love to help others and wanted to make sure that everyone would always have someone there for them. </p>
                            <p>Throughout my time at Scope, I took on a variety of diverse roles that you would not see clash within the retail industry. I would interact with customers, at the till, to help them purchase items so my communication skills had to be great and I was told on multiple times that my friendly nature helped me acquire friendships with the regular customers. Moreover, I helped around the shop with hanging up clothes, restocking and cleaning the store overall, this was a labour-heavy part of my volunteering job which allowed to gain the skill of never giving up, with customers walking in and out all the time, clothes that I had just put away properly were found on the floor. </p>
                            <p>One of my favourites parts of the volunteering job was being able to sort and tag all the clothes. All the clothes that are donated to us would be sorted and tagged behind the shop floor, which was fun because I was able to use a tagging gun and I liked pricing the items that would go on store, there was no set pricing so I had to make good judgements. I often took on a leadership role at the shop and others would ask me about the pricing.</p>
