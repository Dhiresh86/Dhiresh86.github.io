          <p>I worked with Drum Roll HQ on the <a href="https://eraseallkittens.com/">Erase All Kittens game,</a> that teaches kids to code through an online hackable and changeable game.
            I was the leader of a workshop and worked alongside the company with the Friday Science Fair and across all three days,
            where I was present helping out with different tasks. Successfully completing all these tasks and also talking to new and interested people within the field
            of drones and aerospace engineering in which I would like to embark my journey on.</p>

          <h6 class="w3-text-teal"><i class="fa fa-calendar fa-fw w3-margin-right"></i>July 2016 - March 2017</h6>
          <p>I played a vital role at the Scope shop in Harrow for 8 months as
            I worked there to give back to the community. I found Scope Charity shop
            through my Duke Of Edinburgh Award, although not completing my Duke Of Edinburgh
            award I continued to work at Scope. Over the months I was there to work solely to
            achieve the award I came to the realisation that there is not enough people volunteering
            at the shop, or any charity shop really. I continued there because of my love to help others
            and wanted to make sure that everyone would always have someone there for them. Throughout
            my time at Scope, I took on a variety of diverse roles that you would not see clash within the
            retail industry. I would interact with customers, at the till, to help them purchase items so
            my communication skills had to be great and I was told on multiple times that my friendly nature
            helped me acquire friendships with the regular customers. Moreover, I helped around the shop with
            hanging up clothes, restocking and cleaning the store overall, this was a labour-heavy part of my
            volunteering job which allowed to gain the skill of never giving up, with customers walking in
            and out all the time, clothes that I had just put away properly were found on the floor. One
            of my favourites parts of the volunteering job was being able to sort and tag all the clothes. All
            the clothes that are donated to us would be sorted and tagged behind the shop floor, which was fun
            because I was able to use a tagging gun and I liked pricing the items that would go on store, there was
            no set pricing so I had to make good judgements. I often took on a leadership role at the shop and others
            would ask me about the pricing.
