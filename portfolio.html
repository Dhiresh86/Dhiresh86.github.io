          <p1>I became greatly interested in drones since a young age due to viewing this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cTrLDew4-gw">video</a>,
            I had watched it several times and was interested in how drones worked and how I could make my own. I began researching different systems
            that I could build and how much each would cost. Starting from buying some parts on Amazon for Â£80 it lead me on a 2-year-long road spending
            a lot more money for building and fixing the same drone. I learnt a lot about how drones work, the uses of drones and what some of my personal
            and what industrial applications for drones could be. </p1>

          <p1>When I became exposed to Raspberry Pi's and their amazing capability I continued my research and looked out for projects I could do with the
            new Raspberry Pi Zero W that had came out. This amazing little machine had Wi-Fi, camera functionality and amazingly fast processing for such a
            small device. I used this to become the powerhouse of my Arcade Machine that I built from a very old arcade machine, if you want to see how old,

          <p1>During my time at Park High school I had built a very strong reputation of being the student that would always go beyond any normal project that
            other students were doing. I would be the youngest, best student in Engineering and using my skills to learn new technology quickly and efficiently,
            whilst also applying it in real-time and practicing first-hand. I continued this reputatation for the whole time I was at Park High School. One of
            the main things that I had accomplished was I created my own STEM club for the younger students within the STEM club that was exclusively for the
            Year 10's and Year 11's.

          <p1>There was a time when I used the Arduino Uno and the Raspberry Pi to do everything....I mean <i>everything</i>. I used to make up problems that we had
            around the house just so I had the chance to use these amazing devices to make a solution. I used my knowledge of python to create small devices that I could
            play with just to pass the time. I managed to use the Arduino to create a fun remote control car laser pointer for my cat, so whilst I had fun controlling the
            car, my cat was enjoying her time playing with the laser. It was a win-win.

          <p1> As I increased my skill-set I managed to keep learning HTML and CSS. I used these programming languages to help me update my website on a regular basis and
            used a Bootstrap template to help me increase the scalability and accessibiilty of my website across all devices. This allowed me to engage with a larger audience
            and through this I was able to acquire more experienced contacts. From this point on, I realised how important Networking was and used this realisation to attend
            lots of events. The Percentage Caclulator App was made using a YouTube tutorial series in which the end goal was to make this app. It did not take me a long time to
            realise how valuable Javascript was when creating apps and I instantly logged on to <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> to learn this language.

          <p1> One of the most amazing places I have ever been to that encouraged makers and collaboration was the FabLab London. It was a huge space that gave everyone access
            to 3D Printers, CNC Machines and lots of resources. I had been here previously with my brother to do some 3D Printing, however I was here for an event when I was a
            part of creating this HighFi device. At the hackathon, I was in a team that wanted to provide rural areas, that had been recently struck by a natural disaster, or
            otherwise, with WiFi coverage to increase the communication with others around the world. By providing these places with WiFi, locals could contact their family and
            let them know they are okay. This could also have been used a way to minimise the need for Search and Discover because you could monitor how many devices were connected
            to a specific network and the idendity of these locals.

            a laptop/computer into thinking you are the keyboard. By using you as a selection and grounding system you can use it for many different uses. You can use it to play games
            or to show off a rocket-research project, like I did. Check it out in this section!
