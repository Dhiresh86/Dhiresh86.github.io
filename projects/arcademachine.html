          <p1> This project was on of my most hands-on work, with real labour! <br/>
            <br/>
            First of all, I bought an old, broken arcade machine from Gumtree, the seller had told me that nothing on the inside
            was working and it had suffered water damage, so he had it on sale for the wood parts especially. Which was exactly what
            I wanted :)  I managed to negotiate the price from £40 down to £15, which was even better for me because I wanted to be
            spending more on the project itself and not just the casing. Fortunately, the seller was only about a 20 minute drive
            from me so this made transportation a lot easier, we managed to fit it into my mum's car. <br/>
            <br/>
            <img height="332" width="187" align="left" src="assets/arcademachine/open.jpg">
            After getting it home and into our house, I was eager to see what was inside, how it was built and what engineering processes
            were used to create such a durable product. The seller provided me with all the keys to open up the arcade machine storage compartments
            as well as the whole top. It was very well made but extrememly heavy. Opening up the arcade machine really gave me an insight into how
            each part fits together easily for manufacturing.<br/>
            <br/>
            I then powered it up and as the seller stated, nothing worked. This meant that I had to completely strip it down to the point where
            only the outisde shell was left. So that is exactly what I did.
            <img height="332" width="187" align="right" src="assets/arcademachine/stripped.jpg">
            By forcing myself to manually remove everything from the shell
            I discovered lots of engineering processes, like pop-rivetting which was very common across the whole Arcade Machine. Also, the
            screen was very old, and only being 12-years-old I had no knowledge about the old screens. So, I googled the parts-number and
            saw how they were built, being used and how they worked in general. This allowed me to build up my knowledge in the history of
            the technology.
