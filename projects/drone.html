          <p1>We are all alive in such a great time, people are everywhere using technology and having
            easy access to lots of resources right at their fingertips. There are lots of different
            ways to use technology and each has it's own advantages and disadvantages. Throughout the
            last couple of years I have used technology to help expand my knowledge and gain skills, that
            otherwise would not have been available to me. There was always a hierachy in the ways people would
            receive information and being a 12 year old, I was very much at the lower-end of that hierachy, with
            the main priorities being given to businessmen and women.<br />
            <br />
            My parents would always encourage learning, and being brought up with the mindset that everyone
            has to compete for the same job, and even getting a 1st-class degree is not enough if you have not
            done anything else externally. This had always bugged me because I knew that I would always want
            to achieve everything at the highest level and always be a person everyone comes to. With this
            in mind, I managed to build up my self confidence and become independent: for my learning, my skill-set
            and who I was and who I was going to be as a person. As a young-boy I used the amazing resources
            my parents provided me, like my own laptop and access to the internet all the time, there was
            never any restrictions and I appreciated this so much because it allowed me to constantly build
            who I am today. Without the resources I had I would not have been able to learn so much and do
            so much with my time.<br />
            <br />
            Moreover, I made sure that I would attend lots of events, get my name out there and show people who I actually
            am.
