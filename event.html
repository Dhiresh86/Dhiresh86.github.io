          <p>I worked with Drum Roll HQ on the Erase All Kittens game, that teaches kids
            to code through an online hackable and changeable game. I was the leader of a
             workshop and worked alongside the company with the Friday Science Fair and
             across all three days, where I was present helping out with different tasks.
             Successfully completing all these tasks and also talking to new and interested
             people within the field of drones and aerospace engineering in which I would
             like to embark my journey on.</p>

          <p>I attended an event at the FabLab London, which was one of the key events that
          changed my view on technological innovation. (for the better) This event opened my eyes
          to the technology that could help less fortunate, or those from LED's, less-economically
          developed countries. Technology is not accessible to them as it is for us so being part of a team
          whose main thesis was to be able to provide LED's or countries that had just experienced a natural
          disaster with the same Wi-Fi bandwith that we all take for granted today. Once I saw I was able to
          help the less fortunate with something I use all the time and this would be part of a better community,
          I knew I wanted to be a part of the technology industry. </p>

          <p1>This hackathon was by far the best because of all the huge companies that had sponsored
            it, like Paypal, (include here the other companies....) and Techcrunch themselves, of course.
            They had held the event at a historical venue, where the James Bond Skyfall prison scene was filmed,
            with the underground tunnels. Having access to a huge amount of kit, which myself and my brother
            brought to the event gave us a headstart in coming up with projects to do for the two-event day.
            However, I spent a lot of time understanding and using an Arduino from the original handbook whilst
            everyone else at the event worked on their projects. I made sure that by the end of the event I was
            confident in troubleshooting and the basics of using an Arduino. I was also introduced to the
            Raspberry Pi which allowed me to add UI's to any project I wanted. It had felt like I was in
            hardware-heaven.

          <p1>My brother, Manoj Nathwani, held his own hackathon which turned into one huge NERF war across
            the beatiful offices of Nexmo, lots of food, drinks and awesome facilities resulted in lots of
            production, well kind-of. Throughout the two day event I took the opportunity to use the amazing
            facilities, like each person having two wide monitors with huge desks. I had my own office-room
            at the event because I set up RetroPie on a TV screen where anyone could come and have a game.
            It was a huge success so I moved it to the Kitchen and of course, being a technology company
            they had table tennis in the kitchen and lots of screens around. I hooked it up in the kitchen
            to attract even more users and allow for more space.
